#airplayerjs

A bookmarklet to enable streaming (some) video content to your Apple TV

##Usage (Requires iOS 4.3)

Check out [installing the bookmark](http://andrewgleave.github.com/airplayerjs/)
   
##Demo

You can try it out on <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/video.html#video">Dive into HTML5 video</a>.</p>
   
*Your Milage May Vary: This is just a DOM hack and doesn't always work. If it fails to play, dismissing the video and then tapping on it again (without running the script for a second time) will sometimes get running.*

##Disclaimer
I take no responsibility whatsoever for your usage of this script.
